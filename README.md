# Wallpaper Scheduler


[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Hapovanille/wallpaper-scheduler)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/Hapovanille/wallpaper-scheduler)

The idea of this small project is because the IT department of my company resets my laptop wallpaper randomly and frequently. Writing a go app is definitely not the most straight forward solution. Some more straightforward approaches could be cronjobs, Automator workflows, systemd, etc.

## Permission requirement

## Next step
1. customize/select desktop pictures
2. maybe show a red `!` on the system tray icon to show the app is not functioning
3. customize the way of switching selected pics. e.g. constant/random time interval; dynamic wallpaper with a cycle of a month, etc.
